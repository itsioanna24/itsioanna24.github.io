                        <h3>The Importance of E-Portfolios in Postgraduate Education</h3>
                        <p>For my first assignment, I contributed to a discussion forum on the role of e-portfolios in postgraduate education. I explored how e-portfolios serve not only as a collection of academic work but also as a powerful tool for reflection, professional growth, and career advancement. Drawing on recent research, I emphasised their increasing use since the COVID-19 pandemic, their role in helping students set learning goals, and their ability to differentiate graduates in a competitive IT job market.</p>

                            <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> This task helped me understand the importance of clear academic writing conventions, such as defining acronyms (e.g., Artificial Intelligence (AI)) and adhering to UK English standards. It reinforced how e-portfolios can be used to showcase growth, potential, and professional skills in a meaningful way.</p>
