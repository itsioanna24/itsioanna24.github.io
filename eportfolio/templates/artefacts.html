                        <h3>Discussion Forum Contribution: The importance of e-portfolios in Postgraduate Education</h3>
                        <p>In this activity, I explored my preferred learning style using the VARK questionnaire. I identified as a multimodal learner, benefiting from visual aids, hands-on practice, and discussion. In the forum, I shared my results, explained how they shaped my approach to online study, and engaged in conversation with peers to compare learning preferences.</p>
                        <p>Through peer interaction, I developed a deeper appreciation for diverse learning strategies and gained insights into how others adapt to challenges in virtual learning environments.</p>
                        <div class="tutor-feedback">
                            <strong>Tutor Feedback:</strong> "Your reflections on multimodal learning were well articulated and demonstrated self-awareness. The engagement with peers showed good academic collaboration."

It reinforced how e-portfolios can be used to showcase growth, potential, and professional skills in a meaningful way.</p>

                        <h3>Referencing Task: Harvard Style</h3>
                        <p>For this task, I applied the Harvard referencing style to a range of academic sources, including journal articles, books, and websites. The activity reinforced the importance of academic integrity and consistency in citation format. I learned to avoid common errors such as missing publication dates or incorrect punctuation.</p>
                        <p>Completing this task gave me confidence in preparing references for future assignments, ensuring my work meets academic standards.</p>

                        <h3>Personal Study Plan</h3>
                        <p>I developed a detailed study plan to manage my workload alongside professional commitments. This included setting weekly targets, blocking dedicated study hours, and building flexibility for unexpected changes. The plan also incorporated rest periods to maintain well-being and avoid burnout.</p>
                        <p>This exercise improved my time management skills and helped me stay on track with deadlines throughout the module.</p>
